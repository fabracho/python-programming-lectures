# A Collection of iPython Notebooks for teaching Python.

This repository contains a curated set of iPython Notebooks about
introductory materials for programming in Python.

Some (so far, *most*) of these notebooks have been borrowed by the
ones available in the [Introduction to Programming](http://www.introtopython.org) 
course material by [Eric Matthes](mailto:ehmatthes@gmail.com)

You can view the HTML version of the notebooks using the **iPython Notebook Viewer** service:
([index page](), 
[course syllabus]()). 

## Goals ##

Available notebooks are intended to aid both students and teachers in learning and teaching 
Python programming, respectively. 

In more details, the goals of this project are:

- Introduce students as quickly as possible to the basics of Python programming;
- Introduce best practice as early as possible, while remaining accessible to students with no background in programming at all;
- Provide teachers an easy-to-use set of notebooks that is ready to be converted in slides for their classes 
  (please see the Section [Teaching Material](#slides) for further details)

## Programming Environment

These notebooks are written primarily in Python 3. 
If the default Python on your system is Python 3, then you will have a simpler time contributing to the project. 
If you only have Python 2, you might want to consider adding Python 3 to your system. 
In this regards, you may find useful to take a look at the *Programming Environment* [notebook]() where you 
could find links and details on how to set up your environment depending on your platform.

Provided notebooks can be easily convertible in HTML slides by the `nbconvert` command of iPython.

To view and modify the details about slides segmentation and organization, you are just required to 
enable the **Slideshow** mode on the *Cell Toolbar* during a running iPython notebook session.

The folder `slides` contains all the converted versions of the notebooks that are ready to be used.

These slides are mainly intended to be used by teachers in their programming classes.

### Convert notebooks as HTML slides:
